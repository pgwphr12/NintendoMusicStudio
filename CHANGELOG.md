# Nintendo Music Studio — changes

## 1.5 —2026-11-01 public package

- Public name Nintendo Music Studio1.5; executable NintendoMusicStudio.exe; Windows product/version/dialogs/default-app identity updated.
- Preserves1.4.18 playback code, including SCC native-rate/downsampling and chip-count gain fixes verified against1.4.15.
- Preserves N64 playback/voice taps through licensed Cog-pinned lazyusf2 and the licensed VGM replacements.
- Preserves independent pitch/speed0.01 steps,76%/3.0s reverb defaults, bulk channel gain, recording view and modeless F1 fix.
- English channel labels, existing GBA voice/visibility and monitor-paced waveform behavior retained. Universal GBA/other-chip support is not claimed.
- Player-only: composition/editing/project/WAV-export paths remain removed.
- Complete matching source, license notices, rebuild/relink instructions, SHA256 manifests and bounded/self-authored regression tests included.
- Legacy settings location retained to preserve prior preferences. Older releases/original music are preserved.

## 1.4.18 — sound regression correction

SCC generation at clock/16 was incorrectly treated as48kHz in16/17, lowering pitch; fixed native-rate conversion and native-cell interval averaging. Removed arbitrary sqrt(chip-count) mix attenuation. Whole supplied VGM compared to15: SCC correlation0.9999999994, whole mix RMS difference~0.05%. Added pitch/silent-extra-chip gain regression checks.

## 1.4.17 — N64 license replacement

Replaced old Project64-restricted N64 tree/archive with specifically GPL-declared official Cog lazyusf2 source, preserving original exceptions and read-only voice taps. N64 remains enabled.

## 1.4.16 — VGM license replacements

Replaced unassigned VGM framework/resampler with independent app code, extra undeclared YM2612 with LGPL Nuked OPN2, and old noncommercial ES5506 with zlib vgsound_emu. The16/17sound regression was corrected in18.

## 1.4.15 and earlier player work

Independent pitch/speed, settings/default adjustments, bulk channel gain, recording clock/hidden volume controls, modeless F1, additional tested VGM chips, GBA inspection/individual PCM voices and presentation improvements. The previous editing/composition implementation was removed during the player refocus.
